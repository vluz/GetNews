# getnews
### Dirty simple Python script for news checking for a YouTube channel on AI

Downloads one day of news on a subject, gets the linked web article,
<br>
creates summary of the page, and displays.

<hr>

All in Portuguese language:
<br>
   ➡️Get daily news on a subject from google news,
   <br>
   ➡️download and parse the page associated with news,
   <br>
   ➡️create AI summary of the contents,
   <br>
   ➡️blind-choose between summary and original based on size and *really* dumb logic,
   <br>
   ➡️print output to console and to file.

Note: Do not use this for production, it's untested and a ugly hack
