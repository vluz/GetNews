# Get News
### Dirty simple news checking Python script

<hr>

Intended use later as a component on another larger project, 
the full automation of a YouTube channel.

Will use Pegassus for Summary in a later iteration.

<hr>

Downloads one day of news on a subject, gets the linked web article,
<br>
creates summary of the page, and displays.

<hr>

All in Portuguese language:
<br>
   ➡️Get daily news on a subject from google news,
   <br>
   ➡️download and parse the page associated with news,
   <br>
   ➡️create AI summary of the contents,
   <br>
   ➡️blind-choose between summary and original based on size and *really* dumb logic,
   <br>
   ➡️print output to console and to file.

Note: Do not use this for production, it's untested and a ugly hack

TODO: Switch over to Pegassus summaries like this: https://github.com/vluz/Summary
