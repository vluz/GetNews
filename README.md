# getnews
Dirty simple Python script for news checking

All in Portuguese language:
<br>
   Get daily news on a subject from google news,
   <br>
   download and parse the page associated with news,
   <br>
   create AI summary of the contents,
   <br>
   blind-choose between summary and original based on size and *really* dumb logic,
   <br>
   print output to console and to file.

Note: Do not use this for production, it's untested and a ugly hack
